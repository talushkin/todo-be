### Assignment Description: ###
Design and implement a full-stack Task Management System that demonstrates expertise in React,Next.js, Java (Spring Boot), and MySQL.

The system should follow best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security, while showcasing thoughtful architectural decisions.


### Part One: Backend (Java + MySQL) ###
###### Tech Stack: Java Spring Boot, MySQL, JPA/Hibernate ######
##### Requirements: #####
Develop a secure RESTful backend using Spring Boot.

Implement JWT-based authentication and session management.

Support user registration, login, and role-based access control (e.g., Admin, User).

Define models for Tasks with fields: title, description, due date, status (open, in progress,completed), and assignee.

Develop CRUD APIs for task management.

Use MySQL as the database. 

Schema design should be normalized and scalable.

##### Bonus: #####
Implement pagination and filtering for task queries.

Use Spring Security and DTO pattern for API design.


### Part Two: Frontend (React + Next.js) ###
###### Tech Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS/Styled Components ######

##### Requirements: #####
Build a responsive and modern frontend using React + Next.js.

Create a UI for user login, registration, and task management (CRUD).

Use React Hooks and Context API or Redux for state management.

Consume the backend API securely using Axios or Fetch.

Handle client-side routing via Next.js&#39;s built-in router.

Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.

##### Bonus: #####
Implement server-side rendering (SSR)


#### Additional Requirements ####
* Code must be clean, modular, and well-documented.

* Limit third-party libraries, use them only when justified.

* Include instructions for setting up and testing the system.

* Add a Swagger documentation for the backend API.


#### Submission: ####
* Upload the code to this Bitbucket repo and specify in the license that it is for non-commercial use only.

* Submit a report explaining the design and architecture decisions of the project.


#### Evaluation: ####
##### The evaluation will be based on the following criteria:#####

* Cleanliness and quality of the code.

* Compliance with technical and design requirements.

* Creativity and innovation in solving the problem.

* Efficiency of the code and system performance.

* Completeness and correctness of the final product.
